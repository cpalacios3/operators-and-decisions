# while Loops
# The while statement in Python is one of most general ways to perform iteration. A while statement will repeatedly execute a single statement or group of statements as long as the condition is true. The reason it is called a 'loop' is because the code statements are looped through over and over again until the condition is no longer met.

# The general format of a while loop is:

# while condition:

##############################ranges#####################################################

# Range Practice #1
# Create a list consisting of all the numbers from 2500 to 2585 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #2
# Using the range() function, create in a single line of code a list consisting of all numbers that are multiples of 3 from 3 to 300 (inclusive). Store this list in the variable my_list.



# Range Practice #3
# Use the range() function and a loop to add the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive). Store the result in a variable called sum_squares.



# For this purpose:

# Create a range of values that you can iterate through in a loop

# For each of these values, find its squared value (power of 2). You may need to create intermediate variables (optionally).

# Sum all the squared values obtained. Accumulate the sum in the variable sum_squares.



##############################enumerators in python #####################################################


# Enumerator Practice #1
# Print sentences like the following on the screen:

# '{name} is found at index {index}'

# Where name must be each of the names in the list below, and the index, must be obtained via enumerate().

# list_names = ["Steven", "Jackie", "Donna", "Kelso", "Eric", "Fez", "Kitty", "Red"]

# You can use the given print() line as an example and change its variable names, but the returned phrases must be the same!

# Tip: use loops!

# list_names = ["Steven", "Jackie", "Donna", "Kelso", "Eric", "Fez", "Kitty", "Red"]

# print(f'{nombre} se encuentra en el ??ndice {indice}')



# Enumerator Practice #2
# Create a list formed by the tuples (index, element), obtained through enumerating the indices of each character of the "Python" string.

# Call the returned list with the variable name indices_list.

# "Python"


# Enumerator Practice #3
# Print to the screen only the indices of those names in the list below, that start with M:

# list_names = ["Maverick", "Alice", "Madeline", "Hazel", "Jack", "Meadow", "Thomas", "Emily", "Mills"]

# You can solve it in different ways, but it will help you keeping mind some (if not all) the following elements:

# loops

# if conditionals

# the enumerate() method

# string methods and indexing

# list_names = ["Maverick", "Alice", "Madeline", "Hazel", "Jack", "Meadow", "Thomas", "Emily", "Mills"]








######################################### zip in python############################################



# Zip Practice #1
# Print to the screen phrases like the following example:

# Use the zip function, loops, and the following lists of countries and capitals to solve it quickly and efficiently.

# capitals = ["Berlin", "Tokyo", "Paris", "Helsinki", "Ottawa", "Canberra"]
# countries = ["Germany", "Japan", "France", "Finland", "Canada", "Australia"]



# Zip Practice #2
# Create a zip object made up of lists, of a set of brands and products that you prefer, inside the my_zip variable.
# brands =
# products =


# Zip Practice #3
# Create a zip object with the translations of the numbers from 1 to 5 in Spanish, Portuguese and English (in that same order), and then convert the generated object into a list called numbers:

# one / um / one

# two / two / two

# three / three / three

# four / four / four

# five / five / five

# The result should follow the structure:

# [('one', 'um', 'one'), ('two', 'dois', 'two'), ... ]

# 1: uno / um / one
# 2: dos / dois / two
# 3: tres / tr??s / three

# Use the range() function and a loop to add the squares of all the numbers from 1 to 15 (inclusive). Store the result in a variable called sum_squares.



# For this purpose:

# Create a range of values that you can iterate through in a loop

# For each of these values, find its squared value (power of 2). You may need to create intermediate variables (optionally).

# Sum all the squared values obtained. Accumulate the sum in the variable sum_squares.



##############################enumerators in python #####################################################


# Enumerator Practice #1
# Print sentences like the following on the screen:

# '{name} is found at index {index}'

# Where name must be each of the names in the list below, and the index, must be obtained via enumerate().

# list_names = ["Steven", "Jackie", "Donna", "Kelso", "Eric", "Fez", "Kitty", "Red"]

# You can use the given print() line as an example and change its variable names, but the returned phrases must be the same!

# Tip: use loops!

# list_names = ["Steven", "Jackie", "Donna", "Kelso", "Eric", "Fez", "Kitty", "Red"]

# print(f'{nombre} se encuentra en el ??ndice {indice}')



# Enumerator Practice #2
# Create a list formed by the tuples (index, element), obtained through enumerating the indices of each character of the "Python" string.

# Call the returned list with the variable name indices_list.

# "Python"


# Enumerator Practice #3
# Print to the screen only the indices of those names in the list below, that start with M:

# list_names = ["Maverick", "Alice", "Madeline", "Hazel", "Jack", "Meadow", "Thomas", "Emily", "Mills"]

# You can solve it in different ways, but it will help you keeping mind some (if not all) the following elements:

# loops

# if conditionals

# the enumerate() method

# string methods and indexing

# list_names = ["Maverick", "Alice", "Madeline", "Hazel", "Jack", "Meadow", "Thomas", "Emily", "Mills"]








######################################### zip in python############################################



# Zip Practice #1
# Print to the screen phrases like the following example:

# "The capital of Germany is Berlin"

# Use the zip function, loops, and the following lists of countries and capitals to solve it quickly and efficiently.

# capitals = ["Berlin", "Tokyo", "Paris", "Helsinki", "Ottawa", "Canberra"]
# countries = ["Germany", "Japan", "France", "Finland", "Canada", "Australia"]



# Zip Practice #2
# Create a zip object made up of lists, of a set of brands and products that you prefer, inside the my_zip variable.
# brands =
# products =


# Zip Practice #3
# Create a zip object with the translations of the numbers from 1 to 5 in Spanish, Portuguese and English (in that same order), and then convert the generated object into a list called numbers:

# one / um / one

# two / two / two

# three / three / three

# four / four / four

# five / five / five

# The result should follow the structure:

# [('one', 'um', 'one'), ('two', 'dois', 'two'), ... ]

# 1: uno / um / one
# 2: dos / dois / two
# 3: tres / tr??s / three
# 4: cuatro / quatro / four
# 5: cinco / cinco / five




#################################################min/max######################################

# Min & Max Practice #1
# Get the maximum value among the values in the following list, and store it in a variable named maximum_value:

# number_list = [44542247/2, 21310/5, 2134747*33, 44556475, 121676, 6654067, 353254, 123134, 55**12, 611**5]




# Min & Max Practice #2
# Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum value in the following list of numbers, and store it in a variable called number_range:

# number_list = [44542247, 21310, 2134747, 44556475, 121676, 6654067, 353254, 123134, 552512, 611665]


# Min & Max Practice #3
# Using max(), min(), and dictionary methods, get the minimum value from the following dictionary:

# dictionary_ages = {"Tony":55, "Paulie":42, "Meadow":78, "Vito":44, "Ralph":24, "Sarah":35, "Evan":19, "Jean":2 ,"Ned":49}

# Store this value in a variable called minimum_age.

# Also, get the name that comes last in alphabetical order, and store it in a variable called last_name.




################################################random in python#################################################
# Random Practice #1
# Implement the randint() function from the random library that allows you to obtain an integer from 1 to 10, and store that value in a variable called random_number.


# Random Practice #2
# Implement the random() function from the random library to obtain a real number between 0 and 1, and store that value in a variable called random_number.


# Random Practice #3
# Use the random library's choice() method to get a random item from the list of names below, and store the chosen name in a variable called raffle.

# For the following list of temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit, express these same values in a new list of temperature values in degrees Celsius. The conversion between type of units is as follows:

# ??C = (??F - 32) * (5/9)

# or expressed in another way:

# (degrees_fahrenheit-32)*(5/9)

# The list of temperatures is as follows:

# temperature_fahrenheit = [32, 212, 275]

# Store this new list in a variable called degrees_celsius
